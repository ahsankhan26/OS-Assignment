## Cigarette-Smokers-Problem

The task was that there are 3 ingredients:
1. Tobacco
2. Matches
3. Paper

There are 4 threads:
- Agent with all Three
- Smoker with Tobacco
- Smoker with Match
- Smoker with Paper

Agent randomly spawns 2 ingredients and only the smoker who needs both ingredients should pick and smoke
